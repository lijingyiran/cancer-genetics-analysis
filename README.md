### Project background

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is the most prevalent form of pancreatic cancer. With a 5 year survival of less than 10%, it is highly aggressive as 80-90% of patients present with surgically unresectable disease [1-2]. We hypothesize that certain genes are more heavily expressed in patients with a longer survival time while others seem to associate with shorter survival. Identifying gene targets would enable us to identify ideal chemotherapeutic drug candidates and create a tailored therapy regimen.

### Project objectives

-   To identify all genes that are more heavily expressed in PAAD patients that have longer survival time compared to those that have a shorter survival time.
-   Training subjects will be classified into a vital status (alive or dead) using appropriate classification techniques

### Directory roadmap

(We may want to edit this once we have better-defined folders. Below an example.) Each directory includes its own README file. In general: 
* [`docs`](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_Genome-Surfers_W2020/tree/master/docs) includes the written portions of the project: main, sections, appendices, and project outline tex/pdfs/aux files. 
  + [:point_right: project final proposal](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_Genome-Surfers_W2020/blob/master/docs/project_proposal.md)
  + [:point_right: progress report](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_Genome-Surfers_W2020/blob/master/docs/progress_report.md)
  + [:point_right: oral presentation files](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_Genome-Surfers_W2020/tree/master/docs/Oral%20presentation)
* [`misc`](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_Genome-Surfers_W2020/tree/master/misc) contains miscelaneous files. 
* [`ref`](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_Genome-Surfers_W2020/tree/master/ref) has the bib file for generating the project's references. 
* [`src`](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_Genome-Surfers_W2020/tree/master/src) includes the R code developed for the project.
* [`data`](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_Genome-Surfers_W2020/tree/master/data) contains data files used for the project.
